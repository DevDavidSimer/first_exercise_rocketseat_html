### Description of the task to be done.

Let's practice what we learned.
  
    1 - Create a project containing 2 files in the main directory (index.html and contact.html)
    2 - One directory named: files inside this directory add 2 images of your choice and 1 file named 
        images.html, that will list the images
    
Inside each .html file, you must put:

    1 - Navigation Menu with an unsorted list
    2 - Page Title
    3 - One or more paragraphs with page information.

Navigation

    For the navigation menu use the <nav></nav> tag and put the unordered list as tag content.
    The content of the link must be the name of the .html page that exists in the project, and 
    for each page we will have a link. When we click on the link, we should be directed to the 
    page clicked on.
    
Pages images.html

    As content of this page, in addition to what was requested, add also
      1 - The two images you have in the folder;
      2 - Use the p tag to place the img tag.
    Notes: very large images may not fit well, but don't worry about that now, we will soon learn how to improve this.

Contact.html page
      
    As the content of this page, in addition to what was requested, add also:
      1 - Put your contact information: email and telephone;
      2 - Each piece of information should be within a link that when clicked will open the respective contact information 
          email and phone
    
Tips:

    For the content of the <p></p> tag, if you wish, you can make use of the lorem shortcut that exists in Visual Studio Code. 
    To do this type lorem and then press tab.
    
    Warning: some computers this may not work, so don't hold on to this and continue the exercise without this tip.
    
    Good exercise!
